On the other side of town, in the dark glades, under the rain? Macon is the oldest. Thirty-one. Ex-Marine. I don?t think I?ve ever seen him smile. Army is twenty-eight. A single dad with the most beautiful green eyes. He has no idea who he is, if not a Jaeger brother. Iron will be in prison soon. You?d never think it to meet him. He?s a nice guy, actually. But he can?t stop reacting to everything. Dallas is the one I hate. Twenty-one, cruel, and selfish. He takes and then throws away whatever?s left. And Trace is mine. Or he was for about two seconds. No one can tame him for long. Not that I ever wanted to. It was fun, but now I need to go home. Back to my side of the tracks. Away from the swamps and these men. To my parents? big house. On my clean street. Where I?m never dirty or messy or hot. And I will. I?ll leave first thing tomorrow morning. I just want to crash on the couch tonight. Their house is dark and quiet, </p>
